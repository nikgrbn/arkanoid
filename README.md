# Arkanoid Game
Arkanoid is a Java-based implementation of the classic arcade game. This project demonstrates proficiency in object-oriented design, clean code practices, and software development principles.

## Features
- Object-Oriented Design: The game is built with a focus on separation of concerns, ensuring each class and component has a well-defined responsibility.
  
- Event-Driven Mechanisms: Listener patterns are used to handle in-game events like block removal and ball movement.
  
- Modular Structure: The game logic is decoupled from rendering, making it easily maintainable and extendable.

- Optimized Rendering: Efficient sprite management ensures smooth animations and interactions within the game loop.
